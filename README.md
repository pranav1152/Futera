## TOPIC DESCRIPTION
The future of work/study/collaboration is online. COVID-19 struck fast and hard. In these unprecedented times and a new mode of working i.e. remote
working aka Work from Anywhere, we need to evolve in our mindset and so do the systems that we use in schools/colleges. The idea is to
build android application that can help us manage different aspects of work from anywhere.

## THE SOLUTION
We identified solution of  Work from Anywhere in system which can provide losing hands-on learning from peers with conventional teaching . Our team has built an application which will successfully solve this challenge. In this
application we implemented Online Course Teaching-Learning with Assignment Submission & Interaction with Peers etc.
